# mtoolbox

Prototype mobile toolbox for sending SMS based health information to communities and workers using mBuilder. Developed during Epihack Tanzania on December 2014.

mtoolbox is a client-side only web application that interfaces with [InSTEDD mbuilder](http://mbuilder.instedd.org) for sending SMS messages to population based on their location and role.

## Libraries

This project uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for styling, and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) as a Javascript library.

## Development

The most direct way to serve the application in development is by running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from within mtoolbox's folder, and then open a browser to `localhost:8000`.
